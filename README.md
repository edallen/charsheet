This little app Charsheet is my first learning application in Elm. It's intended to scratch my own itch of having a digital character sheet for D&D 5e that I can use from my various devices during a game.

So far it has flat fields for nearly everything, but no styling or navigation and no persistence. Eventually it will probably have more organized app-style sections for things like spell lists and weapons blocks that are currently roughed in as free text in text areas.

My intended order of further steps is roughly

1) Local storage persistence of a single sheet
2) Local storage of multiple characters that can be selected for loading
3) minimal CSS styling
4) Breakout some sections to more detailed handling
5) Dropbox and/or Google Drive storage for interchange among personal devices
6) Better CSS and navigation
